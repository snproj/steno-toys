.
Recently, an interview conducted by news broadcasting giant CNN on the case of the dispute between Codomo and Mr. Bill Gates, founder of well-known tech giant Microsoft, led to the devastating and shocking attack by Mr Bill Gates on the National High Court. It has been a bewildering turn of events following the devastation that has been wrought, and we're all left wondering: How did this happen?

Most of us may not be familiar with the surreal chain of events that has occurred over the past few years that lead up to this event. Let us take a brief look at the various chains of events linked to this one, and investigate which of these might be the primary root cause of the recent tragedy.

Here we see generated for us a list of the various possible root causes that ultimately lead to the devastating and tragic attack by Gates on the National High Court. In order to better determine which of these might be the primary root cause of the recent tragedy, let us review each of these events one by one.

.
These two events seem to be routine hirings and advertisements by a new company. There does not seem to be anything out of the ordinary about them that could have single-handedly lead to Gate's attack on the NHC.

These two events, on the other hand, represent Microsoft's formal reprimands of Microsoft employees Bob Dingles (current CEO) and Bill Gates (former CEO) for misconduct. This is more interesting. Let us see if we can glean any useful information from the reprimand letters (identical letters were sent to Dingle and Gates each save for differences in names):

.
It is shocking that high-ranking employees of world-reknowned tech giant Microsoft would "[throw] pies in office", or threaten to "flip each others' tables" and "eat their respective desktop computers". We can, of course, see that some very questionable behaviour indeed has been going on at Microsoft, at least from 2019,7,16 (the date of the letters). Now the question comes into mind: Which employee started it?

Let us thusly continue our investigation. We have garnered a social media post from Bob Dingles, as well as a personal email from Gates, and their respective contents are nothing less than absolutely different. We have here a curious insight into the minds of these two famous individuals:

.
As seen from comparing these two pieces of evidence from these two people of reknown, we can conclude that Bob Dingles has anger issues while Bill Gates is a lovable hip young man.

Dingles was the worse hire. We can vouch for that.
