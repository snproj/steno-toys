REPORTER INFERS FROM [R9]: .
Recently, an interview conducted by news broadcasting giant CNN on the case of the dispute between Codomo and Mr. Bill Gates, founder of well-known tech giant Microsoft, led to the devastating and shocking attack by Mr Bill Gates on the National High Court.

\\\\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/////




REPORTER INFERS FROM [R3, R6]: .
These two events seem to be routine hirings and advertisements by a new company. There does not seem to be anything out of the ordinary about them that could have single-handedly lead to Gate's attack on the NHC.




REPORTER INFERS FROM [R1, R2]: .
These two events, on the other hand, represent Microsoft's formal reprimands of Microsoft employees Bob Dingles (current CEO) and Bill Gates (former CEO) for misconduct. This is more interesting. Let us see if we can glean any useful information from the reprimand letters (identical letters were sent to Dingle and Gates each save for differences in names):




/////REPORTER REVIEWS: Microsoft's Reprimand Letters To Dingles and Gates\\\\\

MATERIAL [M4] Microsoft Internal Letter: A Digital Letter on/through Email by Microsoft [Bob Dingles]. SOURCE: microsoft_internal_letter.txt
REPORTER'S PERSONAL TRUNCATION: TWO INSTANCES OF THIS LETTER. A company letter chiding Gates and Dingles for open threats to each other. An excerpt: "The throwing of pies in office and veiled threats to flip each others' tables and eat their respective desktop computers is not condonable professional behaviour and HR will be notified if any nonsensical behaviour continues to occur."

\\\\\--------------------------------------------------------------------/////




REPORTER INFERS FROM [M4]: .
It is shocking that high-ranking employees of world-reknowned tech giant Microsoft would "[throw] pies in office", or threaten to "flip each others' tables" and "eat their respective desktop computers". We can, of course, see that some very questionable behaviour indeed has been going on at Microsoft, at least from 2019,7,16 (the date of the letters). Now the question comes into mind: Which employee started it?

Let us thusly continue our investigation. We have garnered a social media post from Bob Dingles, as well as a personal email from Gates, and their respective contents are nothing less than absolutely different. We have here a curious insight into the minds of these two famous individuals:




______________________________________________________
REPORTER FEELS it relevant and pertinent to PURPOSELY JUXTAPOSE the following 2 elements: [M5, M7]:


COMPARISON ELEMENT 1:
[M5] Dingles' Threat: A Digital Video on/through Social Media by Bob Dingles. SOURCE: dingles_threat.mp4
REPORTER'S PERSONAL TRUNCATION: A social media post where Dingles says that he will "Make Bill regret ever forcing me to taste apple cherry pie. Soon, in the future, it's coming, watch your back, Billy ol' boy." The post has since been taken down but had already been recorded on the source mp4 file.


COMPARISON ELEMENT 2:
[M7] Gates Email: A Digital Letter on/through Email by Bill Gates. SOURCE: gates_email.txt
REPORTER'S PERSONAL TRUNCATION: A personal email requesting a merger between Codomo and Microsoft, phrased nciely, with the phrases "pretty please" repeated 167 times in total throughout the transcript.


ELEMENTS COMPARED: [M5, M7]
______________________________________________________




REPORTER INFERS FROM [M5, M7]: .
As seen from comparing these two pieces of evidence from these two people of reknown, we can conclude that Bob Dingles has anger issues while Bill Gates is a lovable hip young man.

Dingles was the worse hire. We can vouch for that.
